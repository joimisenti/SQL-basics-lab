-- 1. Create a table called person that records a personâ€™s id, name, age, height (in cm) , city, favorite_color. The id should be an auto-incrementing id/primary key (use type: SERIAL)

CREATE TABLE person (
  	id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  	person_name varchar(30) NOT NULL,
  	age INTEGER NOT NULL,
  	height_cm FLOAT,
  	city varchar(30),
  	favorite_color varchar(30)
)

-- 2. Add 5 different people into the person database. Remember to not include the person_id because it should auto-increment.

INSERT into person(person_name, age, height_cm, city, favorite_color)
VALUES ('Yun', 27, 160, 'Guangzhou', 'yellow'),
('Ayse', 33, 155, 'Istanbul', 'green'),

SELECT person_name, height_cm FROM person ORDER BY height_cm desc;

-- 4. Select all the people in the person table by height from shortest to tallest.
SELECT person_name, height_cm FROM person ORDER BY height_cm;
/* or SELECT person_name, height_cm FROM person ORDER BY height_cm asc; */

SELECT person_name, age FROM person ORDER BY age desc;
